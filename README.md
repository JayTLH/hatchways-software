# Hatchways Software Assessment - Report Cards
Created by Jason Huang

In this assessment, I made a simple back-end application using Node.js with the provided CSV files.

## Usage
To run the app first install using `npm install` then run the command

```
node index.js courses.csv students.csv tests.csv marks.csv output.json
```

## Info
The app converts the CSV data and transforms it into relevant student information that provides the total average and course average.
